## Take that!
### Original by Vladimir Mayakovsky.  
### Translated by Konstantin Astafurov.

An hour from now, this pristine alley,  
Will be piping your fat's sickening freight.  
But for you, I have opened poetry's valley.  
With priceless words, I flow, and create.  

Take, you, a man, have a mustache of cabbage,  
From somewhere unfinished, uneaten shchi.  
Take, you, woman, with makeup's thick bandage,  
A clam shelled in stuff, you peek at the sea.  

You'll take the poet's butterfly heartstrings,  
Then pluck and crush, with galoshes and not.  
The crowd of lice will start staging rubbings,  
Their hundred heads vote to strengthen their trot.  

And if today I, the Hun who grinds grit,  
Won't want to put on a show just for you, I'll go  
ahead, and happily spit  
right at your grimace.  
With priceless words, I create and flow.
