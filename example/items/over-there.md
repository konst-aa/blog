### Over there

My glass-eyed gaze is still and blissful.  
There's no one here nor over there.  
"It's warm" I think. The kettle whistles.  
My palms touch strands of golden hair.  

It's warm, yet eerie. Sobbing pebbles  
Repent on floorboards worn and torn.  
My hands grab sticks and lotus petals.  
The trashcan's filled with husks of corn.  

It's bright outside and very verdant.  
My hands, relaxed, press stick to stone.  
The pebbles plead for one strong current.  
I bathe them in a somber tone.  

I lose my edge. The husks are songbirds.  
They flap their wings and off they go.  
I'm small now, so my conscience ponders:  
"We're round and happy. Also slow."
