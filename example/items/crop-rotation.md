## Crop Rotation

The trees voice their indifference,  
And the young green sun tints it with rose.  
I tried injecting inference  
The soil, refusing, clawed its nose.  

With bloody nails, it ripped the blanket  
Along with intention's every smear.  
But what's to change to stop the racket?  
Hmm...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe lotuses this year?
