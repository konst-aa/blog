Pink delicate blossoms,  
stone walls one with creeping vines  
Inconsistent tiling.  

The pale sky repairs  
Punch cards lofted by the wind:  
Tissue-paper leaves  

It's known: moss grows north.  
Telephone-pole rot reclines  
Wherever it wants.  

I swept castlerow  
With bleary eyes. Riverdale  
Was mine from that day.  

So lovely, I shall name it  
Rhododendron. Days go by,  
Soon it'll just be Meh.  

Factories were built  
From good bricks that now belong  
In fireplaces.  

Floral wallpaper  
hangs limply from some dumb bush.  
Such pornography!  

No longer marble.  
Place of battles and lunches.  
Lonely bunch of tiles.  

Apartments so tall  
Many seen through Riverdale  
Continental, yeah.
