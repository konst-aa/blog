## Vessel 
### Original by Boris Ryzhy
### Translated by Konstantin Astafurov

Heads up: "vessel" is a mistranslation of what would translate to "bedpan". However, it's worth it for the rhymes, and it is a translation of the intentionally-used second meaning of the original word.

A white enamel-coated vessel
A window, drawer, and a bed.
It's hard to live and hard to nestle.
It comforts best the almost-dead.

I lie in bed, awake and thinking:
Did that one over there get swathed
In these white sheets once he stopped blinking
And left the world that he once braved.

And water leaves the leaking faucet,
And life's as frayed as a coquette,
And she appears from cold and gauze, and
Sees... window, drawer, bed.

I try to raise myself to reach her,
To stare into her eyes and cry,
And heed her face's every feature,
And cry, and cry and never die.
